<h2><span class="small">About the Author</span></h2>
<p>Roger J. Contor attended the University of Idaho and Montana State
College, concentrating in the fields of zoology, botany, forestry, and big
game management. His association with the National Park Service began
as a seasonal employee in 1949 in Yellowstone where he served intermittently
in various capacities into 1955. Later that year, he joined the permanent
staff of the National Park Service as a park ranger, serving in Yellowstone,
Rocky Mountain, and Bryce Canyon National Parks.</p>
<p>In 1960, Mr. Contor became management assistant for Oregon Caves
National Monument, where he remained until early 1962. He then returned
to Rocky Mountain National Park, also as a management assistant.
He is a member of The Wildlife Society and Phi Beta Kappa and has
authored wildlife articles for <i>National Parks Magazine</i>, <i>Field and Stream</i>,
<i>Outdoor Life</i>, <i>Wyoming Wildlife</i> and <i>Denver Post</i>.</p>

<h2 id="c1"><span class="small">INTRODUCTION</span></h2>
<p>Three tired men unsaddled their horses where the mountain stream
disappeared into the ground. They had fought their way 15 miles over
wild, rugged mountains since leaving Williams Valley at dawn. Yet rest
was far from their minds. Hurriedly they stuck tallow candles into lanterns
made from tin cans, untied a lariat from a saddle, then walked down
the valley. They stopped where the stream, now larger, reappeared from
a shadowy crevice under a cliff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This must be it,&rdquo; said one of them eagerly, &ldquo;just like Davidson said.&rdquo;
And with mixed feelings of excitement, fear, and the overwhelming grip
of adventure, they followed flickering candlelight into the dark opening.
Tales of persons lost for days in other caves were fresh in their minds, so
they uncoiled a ball of string as they went. Later they could follow it
back out.</p>
<p>Soon they knew the Davidson story was true, more than true. Crawling
from one chamber to another, they found a fairyland of weird grottoes
and exquisite stone formations&mdash;pillars and spires, drapes, frozen waterfalls
and grotesque forms&mdash;in shapes and sizes beyond their imaginations.
Some they named from resemblance to familiar objects. At others they
could only stare in awe and wonder <i>how can it be?</i> Using the rope in
steep places, they probed upward into another level of caverns where they
were thrilled to find even more elaborate formations. At one place they
wrote their names and the date, July 11, 1879. Here and there they saw
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
evidence left by the few others who had entered the cave in the five years
since it was discovered by their neighbor, Elijah Davidson. On and on
they explored, returning to the entrance only when their last candle was
growing short. Outside, stars lighted a midnight sky. Exhausted, happy,
they vowed to return, then fell into bedrolls.</p>
<p>Thus early visitors responded to the lure of Oregon Caves: to see the
unseen and to know the unknown. Today, thousands of people enjoy the
caves under less demanding circumstances. Yet the joy of personal discovery
endures. For each visitor about to enter the cave, the thrill of
learning something new and interesting about the earth beneath us is
born anew.</p>
<p>Throughout the world, caves loom large in the scope of history. Early
man used them as dwelling and fortifications. Fugitives hid in them and
thieves used them to cache their loot. Others have found them fine places
to grow mushrooms. During the War of 1812 and the Civil War, Americans
mined certain caves for saltpetre which was desperately needed to
make gunpowder. Much of our knowledge of long extinct mammals has
been gleaned from perfectly preserved remains, and even prehistoric
drawings, uncovered by cave-probing scientists.</p>
<p>To most of us, however, the greatest value of caves is the delight of
seeing the strange beauties wrought by nature through countless centuries.
And from this comes the challenge to understand the imperceptibly
slow, relentless forces which produce them. This booklet sketches the
processes which form, alter and eventually destroy caves. It is an attempt
to share present knowledge with those who visit Oregon Caves National
Monument.</p>
<p>Before going on, let us define the word <i>cave</i> as we consider it here.
True caves are formed in soluble rock&mdash;limestone, marble, gypsum or
dolomite. They usually contain some redeposited mineral in the form
of stalactites, etc. As most caves occur in limestone, the term <i>limestone
cave</i> is often used to describe any true cave, even though it may actually
occur in dolomite or marble. The cave-forming process will be basically
the same for either type of soluble rock. We exclude from this definition
mines, lava tubes, ice caves, and sandstone depressions such as those used
by cliff-dwellers in the Southwest. While they are &ldquo;holes in the ground,&rdquo;
they are formed in different ways than are the limestone type caves, and
therefore are not usually referred to in geological discussions of caves.</p>

<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">HOW OREGON CAVES WERE FORMED</span></h2>
<h3 id="c3"><i>The Raw Material&mdash;Rock</i></h3>
<p>If we could turn back some 180 million years into geologic time, we
would find the North American continent a much different place. This
was the Triassic Period. Early dinosaurs thrived in primitive forests over
much of the United States. The area around southwestern Oregon was
not yet part of the continent; it was a shallow arm of the sea. Smoldering
volcanoes jutted out as cone-shaped islands or poured forth fumes and
lava from the distant mainland.</p>
<p>During quieter centuries the age-old process of life and death went
on within the sea waters. Fish, clams, coral&mdash;even tiny one-celled creatures
too small to be seen&mdash;extracted a mineral called calcium carbonate from
the water. With it they built bones, shells and skeletons. When these
animals died, their hard parts settled to the ocean bottom. Gradually,
layers of calcium carbonate were built up.</p>
<p>At the same time certain chemical functions of ocean plants extracted
carbon dioxide from the water and caused still more calcium carbonate
to precipitate and add to the sediments. The layers deepened. Eventually
the weight of overlying sediments and the ocean above compressed them
into a rock called limestone.</p>
<p>In different parts of the sea, and under varied conditions, other ocean
sediments were deposited. Near the shore, wave-swept sand accumulated
and eventually became sandstone. Fine silt and clay carried to the sea by
rivers settled in bluish layers which were to become shale. Near rocky
headlands, course gravel deposits became cemented into a hard mass
called conglomerate.</p>
<p>This steady formation of sedimentary layers was periodically interrupted
by volcanic activity. Heavy clouds of volcanic ash and fragments
settled into the sea. Molten lava poured into shallow bays or welled up
from subsurface volcanoes to mix with calcium carbonate muds. When
volcanism subsided, the seas went back to the quiet deposition of limestone.
Today at Oregon Caves we find evidence of this interbedding of
sedimentary and volcanic materials. An example of such interbedding
can be seen above the parking area near the Chateau.</p>

<p class="pcap">Marble outcrop</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p>Thus mixed deposits of volcanic and ocean sediments continued to
collect for several million years. Apparently this steady transfer of material
from one part of the earth&rsquo;s crust to another created a crustal imbalance.
The edge of the continent was under a strain. Then, like an
accordion, a tremendous folding of the lands along the Pacific Coast
occurred.</p>
<p>The floor of the sea was lifted above the ocean&rsquo;s surface to form a new
coast line in this vicinity. Violent stresses in the earth&rsquo;s crust created
intense heat and pressure which changed, or metamorphosed, the rocks.
Shales were altered to slate. Sandstone became quartzite. Limestone became
the marble so important to Oregon Caves. Even the volcanic materials
were altered considerably from their original form. The resultant
geological belt composed of inter-bedded layers of slate, quartzite, marble,
and metamorphosed volcanics is known as the Applegate Group.</p>
<p>After the uplift, there was a long period of crustal stability. The folded
mountains were eroded away and the area became a flattened plain
near sea level. As a result, its streams were sluggish and meandered slowly
to the ocean. Then, in various stages, the plain was uplifted in another
period of crustal adjustments which produced a flat-topped plateau, so
to speak, known as the ancient Klamath Peneplane. This restored the
vigor of the stream erosion, which helped at times by glacier sculpture,
dissected the plateau into the mountains we know today. The Siskiyou
Range surrounding Oregon Caves National Monument is part of the
Klamath Mountain System.</p>
<p>Let us focus on one of the ancient marble layers of the Applegate
Group, for this is the rock strata in which Oregon Caves were formed.
It is actually a narrow, tilted belt, varying in thickness up to 400 feet. It
dips eastward into the earth at an angle of about 60&deg; and can be followed
in a southwest-northeast direction for about 4 miles along the west
shoulder of Mt. Elijah (see illustrations on <a href="#Page_4">page 4</a>). Examination
of the marble layers inside the exit tunnel or the outcrop at
the beginning of Cliff Nature Trail reveals many fractures caused by the
stresses of upheaval. Some are vertical cracks, but there are also many
cross fractures at varying angles.</p>

<p class="pcap">Oregon Caves marble&mdash;8 inches wide</p>
</div>
<p>When tested for chemical composition, Oregon Caves marble samples
have averaged 93 percent pure calcium carbonate (CaCO&#8323;). Its bluish
color is derived from the remaining percentage of impurities. Without
these, it would be white. A good example of nearly pure calcium carbonate
is the white chalk used on blackboards.</p>
<p>Without this belt of soluble marble, and without the fractures within
it, natural processes could not have produced the &ldquo;Marble Halls of
Oregon.&rdquo; It is the foundation, the framework, and the raw material of
the caves.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<h3 id="c4"><i>Underground Erosion</i></h3>
<p>The first requirement in the genesis of Oregon Caves&mdash;the right kind
of rock&mdash;was met. Next came the erosive agent which was to carve it into
caverns. This was the flow of underground water.</p>
<p>The present rainfall in this area averages 50 inches a year. During the
many thousands of years the caves were forming, the climate may have
varied from wetter to drier many times, but it is safe to assume this has
always been an area of relatively heavy precipitation. The steep, mountainous
terrain and deep-cut valleys of southwestern Oregon are characteristic
of aggressive stream erosion that goes hand-in-hand with a
healthy supply of rainfall.</p>
<p>Some of the rain evaporates and returns to the air. Some of it soon
runs into streams and is carried rapidly to the ocean. The rest of it seeps
into the ground where it is delayed for a time in its inevitable return to
the sea. Under the force of gravity, it trickles downward rather steeply
through joints and cracks in the rocks, or seeps between particles of sand,
gravel, or clay. Below the ground surface it joins a zone of saturation, or
<i>phreatic zone</i>.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig5">
<img src="images/p06a.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="489" />
<p class="pcap"><i>GROUND WATER</i></p>
</div>
<dl class="undent pcap"><dt>RAIN FALL</dt>
<dt>} <i>Vadose zone: water moves from surface to water table (vertically)</i></dt>
<dt>&mdash;<i>Water table</i></dt>
<dt>} <i>Phreatic zone: total saturation, water moves slowly and nearly (horizontally)</i></dt></dl>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>Here cracks, pores, and all spaces within the rock are completely filled
with water. There are no airspaces. Water movement within the phreatic
zone is comparatively slow, varying from a few inches a year to a few feet
a day, depending upon the permeability of the rock structure. And the
movement is usually horizontal, following the contours of the land in
the same direction as surface streams. Eventually this water will find its
way back to the surface at a lower elevation where it usually emerges as
a spring. It is phreatic water which feeds the mountain streams and rivers
many weeks or months after the last rainfall. It might also be pumped
from a well for human use. A large portion of the earth&rsquo;s population
depends upon well water from these great underground reservoirs.</p>
<p>How deep does phreatic water exist? This depends upon the porosity
of the rock, or its ability to contain water. Most mines that penetrate
many hundreds of feet encounter little water at great depths. Pressure
of the overlying rocks is so great that open spaces capable of holding water
cannot exist. So the earth&rsquo;s crust contains available well water only in
restricted zones not far from the surface. The top of the zone of saturation
is called the <i>water table</i>. It is here that the most rapid flow of phreatic
water occurs, for the joints and interspaces are wider nearest the surface.
Between the water table and the surface is the <i>vadose zone</i>, in which the
spaces are partly filled with water and partly filled with air. (See illustrations
on <a href="#Page_7">page 7</a>). Vadose water content varies greatly with weather
conditions. As rainfall is scant in southwest Oregon during the summer,
visitors find the caves relatively dry at that time. In the winter, however,
the passages will be veritably &ldquo;raining&rdquo; vadose water within a few days
after snow or rain.</p>
<p>The water table itself is more stable, but varies somewhat from winter
to summer, or during extended periods of unusually wet or dry seasons.
Its lowest possible level is ultimately controlled by the elevation of the
largest nearby surface stream or lake, which acts as a base level. When the
streams and lakes are lowered by erosion, the water table of a given locality
keeps pace by slowly sinking until eventually it lies scarcely above
sea level.</p>

<p>Rain falling on the mountains above the cave seeps into the surface
cover of vegetation and humus. Here it absorbs carbon dioxide released
from the process of organic decay. Seeping further through the vadose
zone and down to the water table, this water carries many times the
normal amount of carbon dioxide found in the atmosphere. In fact, it
becomes acid. For water (H&#8322;O) and carbon dioxide (CO&#8322;) unite to form
a mild solution of <i>carbonic acid</i> (H&#8322;CO&#8323;). In this manner,
phreatic water is constantly charged with mild acids. Not the kind that
harm us, of course. The fountain water by the chalet, and probably that
in your home, is actually mild carbonic acid. So is bottled pop.</p>

<p>It was thus that phreatic water, charged with soil acids, percolated
century after century through cracks in the marble. The acids ate away
at all exposed rock surfaces&mdash;sideward, downward, and upward. (The
solution rills in the original Ghost Room ceiling reveal the upward
dissolving of water-filled cavities, see illustration <a href="#Page_9">page 9</a>). To fully
understand this, we must recall that the marble is 93 percent <i>calcium
carbonate</i> (CaCO&#8323;). To dissolve it, carbonic acid mixes with the calcium
carbonate to form an unstable liquid compound called <i>calcium bicarbonate</i>,
(CaH&#8322;(CO&#8323;)&#8322;). The removal of solid calcium carbonate in
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
a liquid is the key cave forming process and is called <i>solution</i> (see illustration
<a href="#Page_10">page 10</a>). In Watson&rsquo;s Grotto we find several examples of early
crack-widening by phreatic solution (see illustration <a href="#Page_9">page 9</a>).</p>
<p>The enlarged cracks allowed faster movement of water against an increased
surface area, and a subsequent increase in solution activity. Partitions
between them fell apart and were dissolved. A series of water-filled
passages evolved deep underground. Their pattern and orientation followed
the pre-cave network of joints and cracks in the original strata.
Gradually the openings were further enlarged into the cave system we
know today.</p>
<p>There is more to it than that, of course. You may ask, &ldquo;Why aren&rsquo;t
there caves continuously throughout the belt of marble? The joints and
cracks are everywhere. And certainly all the marble near the surface has
been subjected to ground water action at some time or another. Why are
Oregon Caves limited to one particular part of the marble belt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The answer to this involves several considerations. To begin with, we
do find small cavities and solution cracks throughout the exposed marble.
So there has been varying degrees of solution activity nearly everywhere,
although not sufficient to produce caverns comparable to Oregon Caves.</p>
<p>Secondly, we must reconsider the mineralized water, calcium bicarbonate.
We called it an <i>unstable</i> compound, meaning it will alter readily
with slight changes in conditions. Once the amount of carbon dioxide
dissolved in the water has united with an equivalent amount of calcium
carbonate (marble), the solution is saturated. No more marble can be
dissolved until additional carbon dioxide is absorbed by the water. If the
solution loses some of its carbon dioxide into the air, then an equivalent
amount of calcium carbonate must be redeposited as solid stone. The
balance can be delicate. In an underground pool of mineralized water,
<i>solution</i> may be going on at one end of the pool and <i>deposition</i> at the
other.</p>
<p>So a state of chemical balance tends to develop in normal phreatic
drift through the marble. Water saturated with minerals might easily
move through many hundreds of feet of marble strata without further
enlarging the openings. Instead, it might even deposit some of the dissolved
minerals, filling small cracks and veins, possibly even blocking its
own passage during dry cycles when phreatic flow is at a low ebb. The
&ldquo;dry&rdquo; room in the cave is an example of vein filling. Clay, gravel, and
other surface sediments can also be washed into the openings, plugging
them up and halting further solution for a time. All these factors lead
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
toward a stabilization of the solution process. Openings and small passages
continue to be formed, yet normal phreatic movement at Oregon
Caves seems to lack the force for large scale cave sculpture.</p>
<p>This opens the door to our third consideration; we know the greatest
amount of solution occurs in the water table zone. Therefore, to gain
the impetus needed to carve out a cave system, some local condition must
have <i>increased the water table flow</i> in the immediate vicinity of Oregon
Caves. The solution process was magnified as larger quantities of freshly
acidic phreatic waters were channeled into a restricted zone. Surging on,
they scoured through the marble, dissolving larger volumes of calcium
carbonate and sweeping it away. The early solution pattern of enlarged
cracks had set the stage for the onset of this swift phreatic erosion. But
some geologically sudden event was necessary to trigger the forces which
completed the act.</p>
<p>We do not know exactly what the triggering action was. We know that
the water table either received a <i>sudden increase in supply</i> from surface
drainage, or found a <i>larger or lower outlet</i> downslope which tapped
phreatic water over a widespread zone and channeled it through a localized
area. There are several possibilities.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. A perched water table may have been held in the cave zone by a
lower and impervious layer of rock. This barrier may have been
suddenly cut through by erosion, as if the plug were pulled in a
bathtub. The perched water would now pass <i>through</i> the barrier,
rather than over it, evacuating parts of the former phreatic zone,
and inducing surface streams to channel underground through the
same route. With such a subterranean diversion of water from a
higher to a lower drainage pattern, the water table flow would increase
considerably. A cave-forming condition would exist.</p>
<p>Several small streams lose their identity and sink into the ground
a few hundred yards above the caves. Doubtless, they join the water
table inside the caverns to emerge at the entrance as the River Styx
(called Cave Creek outside). Possibly they aided in the early stages
of cave formation in a manner described above.</p>
<p>2. It is difficult to imagine what the surface topography was like when
the cave was forming, yet we know it hasn&rsquo;t always been the same.
The mountains were higher. The streams occupied higher positions
in the valleys. The ridges lay in a somewhat different pattern. Now
and then stream piracy, or drainage rearrangement, took place when
a rapidly eroding stream cut away the ridge separating it from a
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
less active stream. Suddenly the slower stream was diverted into the
drainage system of its captor. Both surface and phreatic waters of
the aggressive drainage were increased. The flow at the water table
speeded up in response.</p>
<p>If stream piracy occurred in the drainage overlying the caves, it
might have played an important part in cave carving.</p>
<p>3. Nor can we omit the conditions that occurred here during periods
of glaciation. Shifting masses of ice and glacial debris characteristically
cause damming and rechanneling of water in minor stream
valleys. The temporary results are similar to stream piracy. Coupled
with this is the great volume of water which drains from melting
glaciers. Evidence of partial glaciation in the Siskiyou Mountains
lends serious consideration to its effect on early cave development.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The whole process might have involved all three of the above situations
in varying degrees, for a &ldquo;geologically sudden&rdquo; event may take several
thousand years. Several distinct levels of cave erosion indicate that the
water table moved along at a certain level for a time, then rapidly dropped
to a lower course where it was stable for another extended period. This
was repeated until it now stands near the level of the River Styx.</p>
<p>Successively, the caverns at higher levels were drained and left empty.
So as your tour climbs from the cave entrance to the highly developed
sections near the Ghost Room, you encounter galleries that are progressively
older. The first room inside the entrance, Watson&rsquo;s Grotto, is the
best example we have of a cavern &ldquo;recently&rdquo; drained.</p>
<p>A word about the River Styx. Above it in several places you can see
very smooth walls left by the familiar erosive action of a stream. (See
illustration <a href="#Page_14">page 14</a>). Most of the cave walls show the more pitted,
concave surface left by the acidic dissolving action of phreatic water. The
water which produced the main cave system moved much slower than
the River Styx, and over a wider area. The stream as we see it did not
produce the cave. Rather, the caverns, when drained, left a free flowing
course for ground water to channel into. The only true underground
streams occur in caves. They are a by-product of the cave-forming process.</p>

<p class="pcap">Smooth-walled erosion of River Styx</p>
</div>
<h3 id="c5"><i>Decoration</i></h3>
<p>Surface erosion continued to tear away at the mountains. Streams cut
their valleys deeper. In response, the water table gradually sank below
the level of the caverns and they, in turn, were drained. Air entered the
rooms. The basic excavation process was completed except for a few
minor changes: In some places, vadose water continued to dissolve away
portions of the cave ceilings into dome shapes. In other rooms previously
drained, water re-flooded certain portions during wet cycles. And some
rooms were filled with clay and gravel brought in from the surface, then
washed clean again in later stages.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>Most important is the entrance of air, which ushered in the second
major stage in cave formation. The unadorned grottoes were now to be
decorated. Nature, through the process of <i>deposition</i>, next created the
eerie beauty which delights today&rsquo;s cave visitors. In fact the process continues
even now, for Oregon Caves are &ldquo;live&rdquo; caves, meaning they are still
being decorated by natural deposition.</p>
<p>The weak carbonic acid in vadose water kept eating away the roof
marble above the caves. Reaching the caverns, drops of vadose water
evaporated into the air and left their load of calcium carbonate as thin
layers of solid mineral. The amount left by each drop was infinitesimal,
yet millions of drops eventually left thick deposits coated on the walls,
ceilings and floors of the cave. The crusty white deposits in the Beehive
Room are fine examples of deposition by <i>evaporation</i>. They were left
there in much the same way as the coating in the bottom of a teakettle
or steam iron.</p>
<p>However, evaporation is important only near the surface. Deeper inside
Oregon Caves the relative humidity averages 98 percent. Evaporation here
is almost non-existent. Instead, <i>loss of carbon dioxide</i> becomes the chief
agent of deposition. We have learned that vadose water contains 25 to 90
times the normal amount of carbon dioxide found in the atmosphere.
Much of it, of course, unites with calcium carbonate to form calcium
bicarbonate solution. When this mineralized water reaches the caverns,
large quantities of carbon dioxide are able to escape into the air due to
the difference in carbon dioxide amounts in the water and air. The
chemical balance is upset. For each molecule of escaping carbon dioxide,
an equivalent molecule of solid mineral is deposited (see illustrations
<a href="#Page_10">page 10</a>).</p>
<p>An interesting side effect of the loss of carbon dioxide is experienced
by the cave visitor. Although cave air is constantly replenished by outside
air through natural exchange, it has a rather high carbon dioxide content
due to release of this gas by vadose waters. This partly explains the heavy
breathing you find necessary inside the cave, because the nerve centers
which control our breathing are stimulated by a high percentage of carbon
dioxide in the air we breathe. It also explains the odd &ldquo;peroxide&rdquo; odor
many people notice when they reach the exit. The odor is oxygen. We
notice it because our senses have become adjusted to slightly lower oxygen
percentages inside the cave.</p>

<p>Cave deposits are collectively termed <i>speleothems</i>. Their variety is
infinite: Those left by dripping water are called <i>dripstone</i>, and take on
two basic forms&mdash;if they hang down
from the ceiling they are called
<i>Stalactites</i>, if they grow up from the
floor they are <i>stalagmites</i>. The two
may join together to form a column.
Where the water drips rapidly and
the loss of carbon dioxide is slow,
stalagmite growth is favored because
little deposition can take place on
the ceiling. If the drip rate is slow
and loss of carbon dioxide is rapid,
stalactite formation is favored.</p>

<p>Contrasted with dripstone is <i>flowstone</i>&mdash;smooth
layered deposits left
along walls and floors by flowing
water. In Joaquin Miller&rsquo;s Chapel,
flowstone deposits are many inches
thick. (See illustration on <a href="#Page_16">page 16</a>).
A close look at the structure of dripstone
and flowstone reveals six-sided
crystals called <i>calcite</i>, which is merely the crystalline form of calcium
carbonate. (See illustration on <a href="#Page_19">page 19</a>). Banded crystal layers in cave
deposits are often called alabaster, or cave onyx. These can be easily
seen at the &ldquo;wishing post.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Other shapes and forms accrue. Flowstone forming on backsloping
walls tends to produce graceful sheets called <i>drapery</i>. (See illustration on
<a href="#Page_17">page 17</a>). Reddish bands may develop in drapery where iron oxide is
imbedded with the calcite. Contrasted with the pure white layers of
calcium carbonate, this gives the appearance of <i>bacon</i>. Good examples
of &ldquo;bacon&rdquo; can be seen in the Ghost Room.</p>
<p>Most shapes and forms of dripstone and flowstone are occasionally
duplicated by freezing water. Stalactites form on the edges of roofs, stalagmites
form on the sidewalk beneath them, etc. But one of several cave
formations which can&rsquo;t be thus copied is the <i>soda straw</i> (see illustration
<a href="#Page_20">page 20</a>). Deposition begins as a ring of calcium carbonate around a
water drop. The ring has the unique feature of being a single crystal. As
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
more drops leave their deposits, the ringed crystals form one on the other
to create a tube. The water continues to seep through the inside of the
tube, eventually producing the fragile, crystalline pipe with the obvious
name.</p>
<p>The diameter of a soda straw is apparently determined by the specific
gravity and surface tension of water, for they are all nearly the same
diameter, about one-quarter inch. In a cave in western Australia one soda
straw has reached a length of 20 feet, 6 inches, yet is still only one-quarter
inch in diameter. If the drip rate decreases, the tip of the soda straw may
sometimes seal itself closed.</p>

</div>
<p>Some speleothems apparently defy gravity. Now and then internal hydrostatic
pressure causes secondary formations to project out from others in
unusual directions. These are <i>helictites</i> (see illustration on <a href="#Page_21">page 21</a>). A
related form is <i>popcorn</i> (see illustration on <a href="#Page_22">page 22</a>), the mat of small
nodules which coat the &ldquo;beehive&rdquo; and other objects in the cave. Also
called &ldquo;cave coral,&rdquo; popcorn can form under water or along wet walls in
response to air currents.</p>

<p>Soft, fibrous mats of calcium carbonate deposited near the surface at
Oregon Caves are termed <i>moonmilk</i>. In time moonmilk may harden into
popcorn mats. Its manner of formation is not fully understood.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>At the &ldquo;Devil&rsquo;s Washboard,&rdquo; and at the foot of Paradise Lost, we find
still another type of speleothem&mdash;<i>rimstone</i>&mdash;which forms in pools of
water. Agitated by dripping or flowing water, some of the carbon dioxide
in the pool escapes. The resultant deposition of mineral takes place on
irregularities in the bottom of the pool, or creates stone wavelets where
the pool spills over. Ridges and dams subsequently build up, often constricting
the pool surface (see illustration on <a href="#Page_22">page 22</a>). Another type of
rimstone, or <i>cave ice</i>, develops when flowstone builds up around the edge
of a pool and gradually closes across it. The pool may be completely
sealed over, just like a pond in winter, except that &ldquo;cave ice&rdquo; can never
melt.</p>
<p>Cave students are often confused by another deposition found in the
form of thin <i>blades</i> jutting out of the wall (see illustration below).
They have a woven, crystalline texture. Prior to removal by solution,
some of the marble cracks were filled with calcium carbonate. Being less
soluble than marble, the sheets of calcite crystals remain for a time after
the surrounding rock is dissolved away.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig17">
<img src="images/p13b.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="539" />
<p class="pcap">Blade formation</p>
</div>
<p>So far we have discussed cave features&mdash;<i>speleothems</i>&mdash;created by deposition
of mineral from the solid to liquid, and back to solid state. But
certain objects in the caves are simply what remains of a piece of marble
after some of it is dissolved away. These are <i>speleogens</i>, cave features
created by the dissolving of mineral (see illustration <a href="#Page_24">page 24</a>). They
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
can be striking, but primarily it is
the <i>speleothems</i> which make Oregon
Caves a thing of wonder and beauty.
The zenith of such spectacular development
as seen at Paradise Lost
leaves little doubt of this.</p>
<p class="tb">We have followed the mineral calcium
carbonate through many forms:
from sea creatures to ocean mud, to
limestone and then marble, next to
a liquid solution called calcium bicarbonate,
and lastly as calcite crystals
in cave formations. The size, shape
and variety of cave deposits are determined
by many factors which seem
to prevent any two being exactly
alike. Changes in temperature, relative
humidity, available carbon dioxide,
amounts of vadose water, air
circulation, surface tension, permeability
of roof rock, vegetation above the cave, bacteria action, and the
amount and kind of impurities in vadose water may all combine to vary
the nature of cave formations.</p>

<h3 id="c6"><i>The Cave&rsquo;s Age</i></h3>
<p>The many variables make it difficult to accurately estimate the age of
cave deposits. We have no way of determining past conditions which have
influenced the rate of development. Oh, we know the formations are
many thousands of years old, beyond that we can only guess. Some crude
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
examples of known age are the tiny, one-half-inch stalactites formed in
the exit tunnel since it was completed some 38 years ago (see illustration
below). Bathed in warm, dry air from the outside, they have
probably developed much faster than those inside the main cave. Other
active formations deep in the cave show very little visible depositing over
names written on them by early explorers in the 1880&rsquo;s. So the true
secret of the age of the formations must rest with the cave itself. Perhaps
this is best.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig20">
<img src="images/p14b.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="555" />
<p class="pcap">Stalactites formed since exit tunnel was completed in 1933</p>
</div>
<h3 id="c7"><i>Other Cave Features</i></h3>
<p>An obvious feature you may see in Neptune&rsquo;s Grotto is the brown lacework
on the walls. They are lines of clay. Molecular attraction causes the
clay particles to cling together into what we call <i>clay worms</i>. (See illustrations
on <a href="#Page_27">page 27</a>). Where does the clay come from? Some of it may
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
be washed in from the ground above. The rest of it is the remnant of
marble solution. Oregon Caves marble is 93 percent calcium carbonate.
The remaining 7 percent is non-soluble clay and remains in the cave
after the calcium carbonate is carried away in fluid state. Clay worms are
temporary features; vadose water or the touch of a careless hand can
easily remove them.</p>
<p>In the Ghost Room we find an interesting object. Projecting from the
ceiling is an 8-inch thick slab of angular brown rock. Its edges have been
broken, rather than dissolved. This is a <i>clastic dike</i>. Evidence is lacking
to definitely state its origin or manner of emplacement. But at some time
in the past, there was an extensive crack in the marble which was filled
by a mudlike material made up of bits of quartz, plagioclase, horneblende,
epidote, clay, and other minor ingredients. It may have been
washed in from the surface, or it could have been injected from below
by earthquake shocks which cracked the marble and forced the pliable
material into the cracks.</p>
<p>Eventually it hardened into rock. Due to its non-soluble ingredients,
the dike was not dissolved when the Ghost Room was formed. Like the
&ldquo;blades&rdquo; we discussed previously, it remained as a projection into the
room while the marble walls receded under solution activity. Being brittle,
it has apparently been broken off periodically by the jar of earthquakes
or cave collapse.</p>
<p>Another obvious discrepancy in the marble framework of the caves is
the thin layer of slate found in the 65-foot tunnel. This reveals an interruption
in the limestone sedimentation of the Triassic sea. A thin layer
of shale was deposited between limestone layers. Later, when the limestone
became marble, the shale became slate. It should be mentioned here
that limestone and shale vary greatly in their contents and often interblend
with each other. &ldquo;Pure&rdquo; limestone is white. Different shades occur
with different amounts of claylike impurities. When the impurities overshadow
the limestone, then the rock may be called shale. The whitest
marble in Oregon Caves came from the purest limestone. The darker,
blue-banded marble is rich in slate impurities.</p>

<p class="pcap">The lacework effect of clay &ldquo;worms&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small">LIFE IN THE CAVES</span></h2>
<p>If the Indians of southwest Oregon knew of Oregon Caves they left no
evidence of the fact. Possibly its remote and rugged setting was too far
away from their normal haunts near the fertile valleys and salmon-rich
rivers. Or they may have known of the cave, but superstitions forbade
their entering it. To our knowledge, Elijah Davidson was the first person
to penetrate its depths.</p>
<p>Other creatures used it regularly. Bears, mountain lions, coyotes, bobcats,
skunks and other predators found the outer chambers ideal dens or
resting places. Within the &ldquo;twilight zone&rdquo;&mdash;the galleries near the surface
where some light penetrates&mdash;rodents of several kinds entered freely and
even made nests. Today, we find the industrious woodrat still gathering
mounds of sticks, leaves, flashbulbs, and hairpins to store near the 110-foot
exit. Mice and rabbits are frequently seen in the cave. Occasionally the
tracks of the ringtail betray his secretive hunting trips into the cave. In
1935, even a mountain beaver was found in the Ghost Room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>However, there is only one mammal truly adjusted to normal living
inside the dark portions of the caves. This is the bat. (See illustration
below). There are eight species of bats that use Oregon Caves. Most
common is the long-eared myotis. None are abundant, and most visitors
do not see them, for this is not a &ldquo;bat cave&rdquo; in the same sense as Carlsbad
and other caves. Also, the bats prefer the undisturbed sections of the
caves, where people seldom enter. In spite of this, they attract much
interest and are the subject of much discussion. The only mammal capable
of flight, bats are also unique in their ability to fly in total darkness
deep within caves.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig22">
<img src="images/p16.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="559" />
<p class="pcap">Hibernating bat in &ldquo;dry&rdquo; room</p>
</div>
<p>This latter skill puzzled scientists for many years until, in the 1930&rsquo;s,
it was learned that bats navigate in darkness by echo-location, a system
similar to the Navy&rsquo;s sonar. The animal emits high-pitched squeaks,
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
above the threshold of human hearing. The echo of the squeaks bounces
off nearby objects and the bat is able to decipher, from a flood of up to
sixty echoes a second, the size, shape, and distance of objects before them.
So precise is this system that the animal is able to locate and capture
flying insects in pitch darkness. Not only can they navigate in the dark,
they can also remember echo patterns that help them to return again
and again to the same place deep inside a cave.</p>
<p>They feed at night, eating great numbers of insects. In winter a few
of them hibernate in Oregon Caves and may be easily observed clinging
head downward from the walls and ceilings for months at a time. During
a bat-banding study a few years ago, 750 bats were fitted with tiny aluminum
identification bands and released. To date, however, none of these
bats have been found elsewhere, nor have any foreign bands turned up
here. Some bats are migratory, for each year in late August or September
there is an influx of several hundred that may be seen in the caves for
only a few days. Then they are gone again.</p>
<p>Certain arthropods&mdash;millepedes, spiders, moths and small wingless insects
called collemboles&mdash;are abundant in the &ldquo;twilight zone&rdquo; of the caves,
where they feed on organic matter and upon each other. Thus animal life
in the cave is more prominent than many people suspect.</p>
<h3 id="c9"><i>Plant Life</i></h3>
<p>When the cave lights were installed in 1932, conditions were established
for the entrance of another type of life&mdash;plants. Carried into the cave by
water or air currents, spores of primitive plants could now germinate and
live. Near the light fixtures we find interesting colonies. The green coating
several feet from the lights are clusters of <i>algae</i>. They have no leaves,
stems or roots; in fact they are the simplest and most universal of the
earth&rsquo;s green plants. They require much less light energy than the <i>mosses</i>
which grow only a few inches from the lights. In one or two places we
also find fleshy green <i>liverworts</i> which look like blobs of spilled paint.
And now and then we find the cave&rsquo;s highest type of plants, the <i>sword
ferns</i>. Diminutive in comparison with their kin outside the cave, these
tiny ferns are nevertheless able to survive near the lights which burn at
least part of every day during the year.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="small">THE FUTURE</span></h2>
<p>What next? Like lakes and waterfalls, caves are temporary features of
the drainage pattern of an area. The same processes which produce them
will eventually destroy them. At Paradise Lost we see that an appreciable
part of the original room has already been filled with cave deposits. Many
side passages in the caves have similarly been blocked off by the accumulation
of flowstone.</p>
<p>On the outside, surface erosion will wear away the roof rock until the
caverns collapse. The rooms will be filled with sunlight and exposed to
rapid weathering. The calcium carbonate that was laid down in the
Triassic sea, then lifted into mountains, then changed to calcite cave
deposits, will again be dissolved by water and carried back to the sea.
We know this because remnants of other caves reveal the pattern of creation
and destruction common to all caves. The end will not come at
Oregon Caves for thousands or millions of years. But it will come. The
work of water and other erosive forces never ceases.</p>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="small">HUMAN STORY</span></h2>
<p>Oregon Caves have been known since a day in 1874 when Elijah J.
Davidson went hunting in the Siskiyou Mountains. The story goes that,
after killing a deer, he followed his dog to a large hole in the mountain.
Here he heard sounds of fighting coming from within. Being undecided
as to what to do, he stood waiting&mdash;then his dog gave vent to a weird
howl, as if in great pain. Hesitating no longer, Davidson rushed into
the opening. He soon found the chase difficult to pursue without a light,
whereupon he resorted to a few matches that he had in his shot-pouch.
Striking match after match, he expected that he would soon be at the
scene of the struggle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>Before arriving there, however, his supply of matches gave out, leaving
him in the dark. Davidson finally found his way back to a running stream
of water, and following it, came to the mouth of the cave. Soon after,
the dog came splashing down the creek, unhurt. As it was well on in
the evening, Davidson decided to go back to camp and return the next
day. Before leaving, however, he placed near the entrance to the cave
the buck he had recently killed. He anticipated that a bear would come
out for food, eat all it could and then lie down by the remaining part.
Returning early the next morning, Davidson found a monstrous black
bear lying near the carcass of the deer.</p>
<p>Davidson told others of his discovery, and the cave soon became an
attraction for the adventuresome, portions of it being explored and
opened. Early interest in commercializing the cave were thwarted by its
remote location, far from roads and populous communities.</p>
<p>In 1907, Joaquin Miller, the &ldquo;Poet of the Sierra,&rdquo; and Chandler B.
Watson, author of <i>Prehistoric Siskiyou Island</i> and the <i>Marble Halls of
Oregon</i>, visited the cave. They were highly impressed and promoted the
cave as the &ldquo;Marble Halls of Oregon.&rdquo; Public attention was aroused and
the cave was established as Oregon Caves National Monument on July
12, 1909. (See illustration on <a href="#Page_32">page 32</a>).</p>
<p>Appreciable public use was not attained until 1922, when an automobile
road was completed to the caves. The next year, 1923, the Forest
Service granted a concession to the Oregon Caves Company, which has
provided public accommodations and cave guide service since then.</p>
<p>In 1933, the Monument was transferred to the National Park System.
Concurrently, the completion of the 512-foot exit tunnel that same year
greatly improved cave tour circulation. The public use pattern, relatively
unchanged for the next three decades, was established after the opening
of the concessioner&rsquo;s chateau building in 1934. The chateau is noted for
its charming architecture, complementing the steep, forested setting.</p>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="small">CONSERVATION AND PRESERVATION</span></h2>
<p>Oregon Caves have been set aside as a national monument because of
their outstanding natural features. The National Park Service is charged
by Congress to provide for the public use and enjoyment of the area &ldquo;in
such manner and by such means as will leave it unimpaired for ... future
generations.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Natural things and natural processes are paramount. Manmade facilities
such as trails, lights and steps are necessary to allow visitors to enjoy
the cave. But they are kept at a minimum. Your guide will ask you not
to touch any of the cave formations. This is to keep them from being
stained or broken. Prior to the establishment of the National Monument
in 1909, fragile formations were the object of severe vandalism and
thoughtless destruction by souvenir hunters (see illustration <a href="#Page_33">page 33</a>).
It is doubly important to preserve the remaining features for the benefit
of those who will come here tomorrow and in later years.</p>

<p class="pcap">Vandalism: Nature required many thousands of years to create these stalactites.

</div>
<p>Outside the cave, the Monument is a place where flowers are enjoyed
in their natural state and not picked, where birds and wild animals are
unmolested by hunters or trappers. The forest is undisturbed. On the
trails away from the cave area, the hiker may see animals and plants
fulfilling their existence as they did centuries ago. It is to this philosophy
that the national parks and monuments are dedicated.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
